🐍✨ A repository to learn and practice Python programming

# 📘 Learning & Revision Repository

This repository is created to **continue my learning journey** from where I previously left off.

I am **not starting from scratch**, as I already know the basics.  
Instead, this repository focuses on:
- Revising concepts I have learned before
- Relearning topics that I have forgotten
- Strengthening fundamentals through practice
- Improving problem-solving and coding consistency

This repo serves as my **personal learning log** and **practice space** as I move forward in my programming journey.
